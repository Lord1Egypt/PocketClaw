# Development Changelog

## 2026-08-24 — Phase 2 Milestone A bootstrap

- Created the independent PocketClaw Android/Flutter foundation directory.
- Selectively adapted the reviewed FUI Android, Flutter, test, asset, and tool
  foundation without copying upstream Git history, build outputs, or caches.
- Preserved the pinned Core `v0.3.1` replacement binaries, Android
  active-network DNS integration, and optional feedback behavior.
- Added provenance, upstream-tracking, decision, handoff, task, and
  third-party-license records.
- Passed `flutter analyze`, all 28 Flutter tests, and focused Core Android
  DNS/model API tests.
- Built and inspected the independent arm64 foundation APK; it retains the
  pinned Core hashes and has no Firebase app ID, API key, or project ID.
