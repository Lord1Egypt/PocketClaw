# PocketClaw Decisions

## Independent repository, not a permanent FUI fork

- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision: PocketClaw keeps an independent Git history and uses PicoClaw FUI
  as a manually reviewed reference.
- Consequence: No `git merge` maintenance path from FUI; upstream changes must
  be classified as security, bug fix, Android runtime, Core compatibility,
  Telegram, provider, MCP, performance, useful feature, UI-only, or not
  relevant before adoption.

## Preserve the physical-device-proven runtime behavior

- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision: Keep the Android active-network DNS bridge, pinned Core `v0.3.1`,
  and optional feedback defaults in the independent foundation.
- Consequence: Never revert to `[::1]:53`, hardcode public DNS, include
  Firebase credentials, or make analytics mandatory.

## Delay package identity and product branding

- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision: Keep the inherited technical package identity until the independent
  foundation builds and is smoke-tested.
- Consequence: Product branding and package-ID changes are a later isolated
  milestone.

## No final license for PocketClaw-authored code yet

- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision: Preserve upstream MIT notices and defer choosing a license for new
  PocketClaw code until product-owner approval.

## Bound the local Gradle JVM for reproducible foundation builds

- Date: 2026-08-24
- Decision: Set the inherited Gradle JVM maximum heap to 4 GiB and metaspace to
  2 GiB.
- Reason: The inherited 8 GiB/4 GiB settings exceed the available headroom in
  the supported local build environment and can terminate the daemon before
  APK assembly.
- Consequence: This changes only build-process memory limits; Android runtime
  behavior and the pinned Core binaries are unaffected.
