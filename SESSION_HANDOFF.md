# PocketClaw Session Handoff

## Current Objective

None. Phase 2 Milestone B is COMPLETE, physically verified, and merged into
`develop`. Do not begin Milestone C until the user explicitly authorizes it,
and do not merge to `main` without instruction.

## Milestone B closure

APK `ba4f067df9811bd0e4af713343bdba632abbf96a41e3a5b47cf154740f70a4b8` passed a
full physical Android device test on 2026-08-25: install, app launch / first
frame, no black screen, Gateway/Core lifecycle, navigation, PocketClaw branding,
workspace path, QR/access page, Skill Hub, provider/model flow, and no abnormal
slowdown. It is the verified reference artifact — compare any future regression
against it before forming new hypotheses.

`recovery/pocketclaw-clean-debrand` was merged into `develop` with a
non-fast-forward merge and tagged `phase2-milestone-b`. The recovery branch,
`feature/pocketclaw-identity` (`354fc38` WIP), and `main` are all intact.

What Milestone B delivered: independent PocketClaw product and package identity;
the black-screen root cause and its permanent fail-closed release guard; full
user-facing debranding including the embedded web runtime rebuilt from source;
`Download/pocketclaw` for fresh installs; the MQTT `/pocketclaw` default with
backward compatibility; and the upstream agent skill dropped from fresh
workspace seeding.

## Permanent release requirements — do not remove

- `packageRelease` fails the build unless the APK contains
  `lib/arm64-v8a/libdartjni.so`, `libpicoclaw.so`, and `libpicoclaw-web.so`.
  It prints "Verified arm64-v8a native payload" on success.
- Canonical release command:
  `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease -Ptarget-platform=android-arm64` with
  `JAVA_HOME=/home/lordegypt/PocketCLaw/.tooling/jdk-17` and
  `GRADLE_USER_HOME=/home/lordegypt/PocketClaw-App/.tooling/gradle-stage-a-clean`.
  A universal `flutter build apk --release` is not a PocketClaw release path.
- If the guard reports `libdartjni.so` missing, do not change application code:
  purge `~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/jni-*/android/.cxx/` and rebuild.
- Rebuild Core via `make build-launcher-android-arm64`; calling
  `make -C web build-android-arm64` directly drops the root `LDFLAGS` and
  produces an unstripped binary. Use `pnpm lint`, never `pnpm check`.
- Core binaries in this build: `libpicoclaw.so` 37,421,409
  `eb895f08...40bd9c88`; `libpicoclaw-web.so` 24,772,961 `6d282df0...1195a5a3`.
  Both stripped; `PICOCLAW_DNS_SERVER` verified present.

## Exact State

This is a standalone Git repository at `/home/lordegypt/PocketClaw-App`.
It has no inherited PicoClaw FUI history. The initial source foundation is a
selective adaptation from the FUI baseline documented in `UPSTREAM_BASELINE.md`.
It is private at `https://github.com/Lord1Egypt/PocketClaw`, with `main` and
`develop` tracking `origin`. The initial commit is `950d4a3`.

The Android service and bundled Core retain the physically verified DNS bridge:
Android active-network DNS servers are passed as `PICOCLAW_DNS_SERVER`; public
resolvers are not hardcoded. Optional Firebase/Umeng feedback defaults to
disabled and requires explicit complete configuration.

Validation completed: `flutter analyze` is clean; `flutter test` passed all
28 tests; focused Core `pkg/androiddns` and `web/backend/api` tests passed.
The Milestone A independent arm64 APK was
`build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`, 32,619,416 bytes, SHA-256
`207a5e4623b6c6ae295a29a874c7a7d6ac9a17552e2ddb2511daa093b085fa4d`.
Its package remains `com.sipeed.picoclaw` version `0.1.3` (code `3`) by
design. Embedded Core hashes match the
pinned records. The release build reported no Firebase app ID, API key, or
project ID and removed generated Firebase resources after packaging.

The foundation physical regression was subsequently confirmed PASS, including
AI request/response, Telegram send/receive, Core restart/configuration
persistence, and no feedback log spam. Skill Hub/ClawHub was also verified:
searching `Crypto` returned 20 results with metadata, URLs, and visible install
actions. The earlier unavailable-registry symptom is resolved by the Android
DNS fix; do not rewrite Skill Hub without new source/runtime evidence.

Milestone B changes product-visible naming to PocketClaw and migrates only the
Android/Dart integration identity to `com.lord1egypt.pocketclaw`. Core names,
binary names, `PICOCLAW_DNS_SERVER`, protocol identifiers, and the compatible
external `Downloads/picoclaw` workspace remain deliberately intact. The second
original PocketClaw mark is the selected primary visual direction; launcher,
adaptive, and monochrome variants derive from it. Do not replace it with a
cartoon lobster/mascot.

The Milestone B physical test then found a black startup screen and noticeable
device slowdown. The root cause is the branded Android launch drawable: both
`launch_background.xml` variants used `<item android:color=...>` in a
`layer-list`; `LayerDrawableItem` requires `android:drawable` (or a child
drawable), so Android cannot inflate the launch window before Flutter's first
frame. The replacement changes only those two items to reference
`@color/pocketclaw_splash_background` and adds a regression test. The 1254 px
RGBA splash mark is 654,845 bytes on disk and about 6.0 MiB decoded, which is
within a reasonable startup budget and was not the root cause.

The fixed validation results are: `flutter analyze` clean; all 29 Flutter
tests pass; focused Core `pkg/androiddns` and `web/backend/api` tests pass.
Debug and release APKs built successfully. The replacement release is
`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`, 33,308,653 bytes, SHA-256
`45be7269af920df4a36eb4eb37171770bbcfa242ed7c071da28874d9c27ebe9e`.
`aapt2` confirms `com.lord1egypt.pocketclaw`, label PocketClaw, launchable
`com.lord1egypt.pocketclaw.MainActivity`, and a compiled splash layer with a
drawable-backed first item. Embedded Core hashes remain
`3b849072a7c2858b0d2c0db5cbcfa42b542353e834f4c473399eda571ab16f3d` and
`252b38c64cbc4dc52277c206ca1b069cc7c3bb97b8a9c276e23f8edc3aaf95e3`.
The service/Core code was unchanged: a fresh Flutter launch does not issue a
Core start request, and the native service has its bounded three-restart guard.
No connected ADB device was available to measure the reported slowdown or
capture final device logs, so that symptom must be confirmed during retest.

## Next Exact Steps

1. Nothing is pending. Wait for the user to authorize Milestone C — provider
   presets and Telegram QR/deep-link onboarding are the recorded candidates in
   `TASKS.md` under "Later", and neither is started.
2. Do not merge to `main` without instruction.
3. Any regression report should start by diffing against the verified artifact
   above, not by patching a plausible-looking runtime path.
