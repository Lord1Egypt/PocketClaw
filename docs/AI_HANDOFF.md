# PocketClaw AI handoff

> **IMPORTANT FOR ANY AI AGENT**
>
> Do not invent a new project-management workflow. PocketClaw already has an
> established engineering workflow.
>
> Repository documentation and Git evidence are authoritative. Chat history and
> model memory are advisory only.

## Read in this order

1. [`docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`](AI_HANDOFF.md)
2. [`PROJECT_STATE.md`](../PROJECT_STATE.md)
3. [`docs/WORKING_METHOD.md`](WORKING_METHOD.md)
4. [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)
5. [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md)
6. [`docs/DEFECT_LOG.md`](DEFECT_LOG.md)
7. [`docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`](RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
8. The relevant record or authorized prompt under [`docs/prompts/`](prompts/README.md)

Detailed historical evidence remains in [`SESSION_HANDOFF.md`](../SESSION_HANDOFF.md),
[`TASKS.md`](../TASKS.md), [`DECISIONS.md`](../DECISIONS.md), and
[`CHANGELOG_DEV.md`](../CHANGELOG_DEV.md). Those are evidence archives. A
phase-scoped statement in them does not override the current snapshot.

## Operating boundary

- Do not begin implementation merely because the next task appears obvious.
- Wait for an explicitly authorized milestone prompt.
- Verify the prompt's branch, starting commit, version, baseline, relevant
  fingerprints, checkpoints, tags, releases, and clean/synchronized Git state.
- Do not broaden scope or combine milestones.
- Do not continue after `STOP`.
- Never assume a milestone is complete unless repository state and evidence
  agree.
- Historical acceptance is immutable. A newer branch artifact does not replace
  an accepted baseline without explicit physical acceptance and a recorded
  baseline advance.

## Current handoff

H2 developer production signing and H3A Dart-hardening architecture/local
validation are closed. The H2 production-signed APK and H3A debug-signed
hardened APK are private validation evidence; neither was installed, published,
or accepted. The accepted physical baseline remains vc62 / versionCode 62.

The next authorized engineering milestone is **H3B — production-signed Dart
hardening validation**, but implementation must wait for an explicit H3B prompt
and owner-controlled hidden local secret entry. H3A already established the
canonical helper, obfuscation, external split debug info, stable generated
package URI, and a local artifact gate with `artifact.dart_snapshot_paths`
passing. Do not treat that development-signed artifact as production evidence.

Do not create a stable tag, publish a release, access a device, rebuild Core or
Managed Runtime, or advance the accepted baseline without explicit milestone
authority.
