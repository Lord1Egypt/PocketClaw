# PocketClaw defect log

This log contains defects and deferred engineering work with reliable repository
evidence. It is intentionally not an invented inventory of every issue ever
found. The operating method has surfaced and helped resolve dozens of defects;
only reconstructable examples belong here.

## Open / deferred

### PC-DEF-002 — Web console listens on `0.0.0.0:18800`

- **Discovered:** vc59 machine validation, 2026-09-08.
- **Component:** Launcher/web console network exposure.
- **Severity:** Unrated security review item.
- **Description:** The Core gateway is loopback-only on 18790, while the web
  console was observed listening on all interfaces on port 18800.
- **Evidence:** `TASKS.md`, “Non-blocking security review”; historical
  `PROJECT_STATE.md` vc59 evidence.
- **Reason deferred:** It predated the milestone that found it and requires a
  product decision about cross-device console access.
- **Target milestone:** Secrets/configuration and exposure audit, before stable.
- **Status:** OPEN.

### PC-DEF-003 — Restart-required banner can remain after hot reload

- **Discovered:** Telegram interactive-menu/model-selection closeout.
- **Component:** Dashboard/launcher state presentation.
- **Severity:** Low / cosmetic, as recorded at discovery.
- **Description:** `gateway.bootConfigSignature` is not refreshed after a
  successful in-process reload, so the Dashboard can continue showing
  “Gateway restart required.”
- **Evidence:** `TASKS.md` and `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` entries named “Stale
  Gateway restart required banner.”
- **Reason deferred:** Unrelated to the milestone and non-blocking.
- **Target milestone:** Dedicated dashboard state-correctness maintenance.
- **Status:** OPEN.

### PC-DEF-004 — `BaseChannel` typing defaults are inconsistent

- **Discovered:** Telegram interactive-menu/model-selection closeout.
- **Component:** Non-Telegram channel typing behavior.
- **Severity:** Unrated.
- **Description:** Non-Telegram channels do not share settled typing defaults.
- **Evidence:** Repeated open entries in `TASKS.md`; historical
  `PROJECT_STATE.md` explicitly says defaults must be decided before gating.
- **Reason deferred:** Product semantics were undecided and unrelated to the
  completed Telegram scope.
- **Target milestone:** Dedicated channel behavior milestone.
- **Status:** OPEN.

### PC-DEF-005 — Versioned non-destructive bootstrap updates are unresolved

- **Discovered:** vc55 investigation; architecture implemented during Bootstrap
  Architecture on 2026-09-08.
- **Component:** Workspace template lifecycle.
- **Severity:** Deferred architecture work.
- **Description:** Binary-owned capability guidance now updates safely, but no
  production behavior offers or merges improvements to a pristine historical
  user template. User edits and `MEMORY.md` must never be overwritten.
- **Evidence:** `TASKS.md`, “Bootstrap architecture implemented”; root
  `DECISIONS.md`, “Product guidance ships in the binary; workspace files belong
  to the user”; current release-gate pending list.
- **Reason deferred:** Safe product behavior requires a separate decision and
  cannot be inferred from file equality alone.
- **Target milestone:** Post-stable architecture unless explicitly reprioritized.
- **Status:** OPEN.

### PC-DEF-006 — Full APK reproducibility is not yet proven

- **Discovered:** H1/H1.5 F-Droid readiness audit.
- **Component:** Release build / Official F-Droid path.
- **Severity:** Blocks the target developer-signed F-Droid publication path.
- **Description:** Core, frontend, runtime recipes, and individual payloads have
  reproducibility evidence, but the final hardened APK has not been rebuilt
  twice and compared bit-for-bit.
- **Evidence:** [`FDROID_RELEASE.md`](FDROID_RELEASE.md), sections 3, 4, 6, and
  8; current release-gate pending list.
- **Reason deferred:** Final APK inputs are still changing during H3 and later
  hardening.
- **Target milestone:** Production artifact hardening/reproducibility proof.
- **Status:** OPEN.

### PC-DEF-007 — F-Droid builder compatibility and committed prebuilts remain open

- **Discovered:** H1.5D source-build audit.
- **Component:** Official F-Droid submission.
- **Severity:** Submission blocker, not an application runtime defect.
- **Description:** All eight Managed Runtime payloads can be built from source,
  but F-Droid builder acceptance of NDK/Rust/Go recipes and the repository's
  committed native prebuilts is unresolved.
- **Evidence:** [`FDROID_RELEASE.md`](FDROID_RELEASE.md), “Remaining F-Droid
  question” and summary.
- **Reason deferred:** It requires final build metadata and external F-Droid
  policy validation.
- **Target milestone:** F-Droid submission preparation.
- **Status:** OPEN.

## Resolved

### PC-DEF-R009 — Cached Dart AOT could outlive its deleted split debug info

- **Phase discovered:** H3B owner production-signing validation.
- **Component:** Canonical Dart-hardened Android build helper / Flutter 3.47.1
  incremental build cache.
- **Problem/root cause:** The helper deleted the expected private DWARF before
  the build, but `:app:clean` did not invalidate `.dart_tool/flutter_build`.
  Flutter reused cached `app.so` because signing does not change Dart AOT inputs
  and the external split-debug-info file is not a tracked cache output. The APK
  assembled correctly while the required private symbol file was not recreated.
- **Resolution:** Clear only Flutter's generated `.dart_tool/flutter_build`
  cache before every hardened assembly so `gen_snapshot` must regenerate AOT
  and private DWARF as one pair. Refuse a symlinked cache path.
- **Verification:** The first diagnostic APK was production-signed and carried
  H3A-identical AOT but had no symbol file; its gate was 23 PASS / 2 FAIL / 0
  SKIP. After the fix, the owner rerun produced APK SHA-256
  `ceef6640d8abd9d084c3ff37d8e903aaf3c82b287de65ec15a37d91124bdebe6`
  with H3A-identical AOT and DWARF. The production artifact gate passed 25 / 25.
  Focused tests cover stale-cache removal, package-config preservation, symlink
  refusal, and cwd-independent symbol resolution.
- **Commit:** H3B closeout commit containing this record.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R010 — Owner signing helper prompted before Java preflight

- **Phase discovered:** H3B owner production-signing validation.
- **Component:** Temporary owner-local signing helper.
- **Problem/root cause:** The first temporary helper collected both owner
  passwords before checking `JAVA_HOME` and Java availability. Its trap still
  cleared the environment and no value was printed or stored, but the secret
  prompts occurred before all non-secret prerequisites had passed.
- **Resolution:** The corrected external helper validates JDK 17, Python,
  Gradle, repository/helper paths, and keystore presence before its first hidden
  prompt. The durable signing policy now requires this ordering for every future
  owner-secret helper.
- **Verification:** A missing-Java dry run exited before any prompt; a
  correctly configured EOF-only dry run completed all non-secret checks and did
  not begin a build. The subsequent owner rerun completed the production build,
  and the helper's exit trap cleared all four signing variables.
- **Commit:** H3B closeout commit containing this record.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R008 — Dart snapshot exposed an absolute generated-source URI

- **Phase discovered:** H2 artifact inspection; resolved in H3A.
- **Component:** Flutter/Dart release artifact and Gradle build path.
- **Problem/root cause:** `libapp.so` embedded
  `file:///home/lordegypt/PocketClaw-App/.dart_tool/flutter_build/dart_plugin_registrant.dart`.
  Flutter 3.47.1's Gradle plugin reads `filesystem-roots` and
  `filesystem-scheme` but does not forward those task fields to `flutter
  assemble`; direct and extra-frontend trials therefore left the absolute URI
  unchanged. The generated registrant also sits outside every package URI root
  in Pub's normal package config.
- **Resolution:** The canonical helper adds a deterministic generated-only
  package mapping before Gradle configuration. Flutter's own
  `toPackageUriForWorkspace` path then emits
  `package:pocketclaw_generated/dart_plugin_registrant.dart`. Gradle rejects a
  hardened compile without that exact mapping.
- **Verification:** Two clean local-test builds with different split-info roots
  produced identical Dart AOT SHA-256
  `c7b2a885ff843a20c57097a0d16ba07c728bd64cf17455a1ce61e6f463a5ae77`;
  the H3A artifact gate records `artifact.dart_snapshot_paths` PASS and 25 PASS
  / 0 FAIL / 0 SKIPPED overall.
- **Commit:** H3A closeout commit containing this record.
- **Status:** RESOLVED; H3B subsequently validated the same contract under the
  enrolled production signer.

### PC-DEF-R001 — Keystore helper could report a blank fingerprint as success

- **Phase discovered:** H2 signer enrollment.
- **Component:** `tool/create_release_keystore.sh`.
- **Problem/root cause:** The helper discarded `keytool` stderr, hiding its
  password prompt and integrity warning. The remaining pipeline found no digest
  but still exited successfully through `tr`.
- **Resolution:** Preserve stderr, pass passwords by environment-variable name,
  share one fingerprint implementation, and validate the output shape.
- **Verification:** `tool/test_create_release_keystore.py` creates a disposable
  keystore, verifies the digest, and proves the passwordless path fails with
  empty stdout.
- **Commit:** `78d33fd5b179dd52c7cd8118a5d23ec19c8368ec`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R002 — Signing pending-state text outlived completed work

- **Phase discovered:** H2 closeout.
- **Component:** Release-gate state and signing documentation.
- **Problem/root cause:** After enrollment, the gate correctly narrowed “key not
  created” to “no artifact signed”; after private validation, that second state
  also became stale.
- **Resolution:** Remove the resolved pending item and update the authoritative
  H2 state without changing signing logic.
- **Verification:** Production artifact gate: 20 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 expected SKIP;
  production source gate: 21/21 PASS.
- **Commits:** `78d33fd`, `7f19309`, `0be6afb`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R003 — `gh` source recipe broke after canonical environment import

- **Phase discovered:** H1.5 source-build proof.
- **Component:** Managed Runtime `gh` build recipe.
- **Problem/root cause:** The Android DNS resolver gained a `canonicalenv`
  import, while the vendoring guard permitted standard-library imports only.
- **Resolution:** Vendor the stdlib-only `canonicalenv` leaf beside the resolver
  and allow exactly that import.
- **Verification:** Two source builds produced identical adopted bytes; manifest
  checksum and packaged payload match.
- **Commits:** `6f117d3`, adopted by `51ed822`–`fb38c7d`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R004 — Python payload embedded wall-clock ZIP timestamps

- **Phase discovered:** H1.5 source-build proof.
- **Component:** `runtime/python-lite-stdlib.py`.
- **Problem/root cause:** Appended standard-library ZIP entries used wall-clock
  timestamps, making each payload different.
- **Resolution:** Use `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, fixed permissions, and a sorted walk.
- **Verification:** Consecutive pinned-epoch builds were byte-identical; adopted
  payload, manifest checksum, and packaged payload match.
- **Commits:** `6f117d3`, adopted by `51ed822`–`fb38c7d`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R005 — Canonical APK packaged Firebase/GMS and fetched fonts at runtime

- **Phase discovered:** H1/H1.5 F-Droid audit.
- **Component:** Flutter dependencies, Android manifest, and app typography.
- **Problem/root cause:** Proprietary SDK dependencies were packaged regardless
  of runtime use, and `google_fonts` defaulted to network fetching.
- **Resolution:** Remove Firebase/GMS from the canonical build; bundle Inter and
  Fira Code with their license texts and remove `google_fonts`.
- **Verification:** Source/artifact gates find no Firebase/GMS/AdMob/measurement
  surface; font contract tests prove local packaged assets.
- **Commits:** `612ce96` and `6f117d3`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R006 — Artifact-only Core provenance check had no comparison value

- **Phase discovered:** vc62 Zero-Pico artifact validation.
- **Component:** `tool/release_gate.py`.
- **Problem/root cause:** `artifact.core_provenance_pair` read a fingerprint fact
  populated only by source mode, so correct artifact-only verification failed.
- **Resolution:** Resolve and cache the Core fingerprint on demand for both
  source and artifact paths.
- **Verification:** vc62 artifact gate and later H2 production artifact gate
  both pass the provenance-pair check.
- **Commit:** `84080a5`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.

### PC-DEF-R007 — H2 closeout initially counted the summary as a gate item

- **Phase discovered:** H2 documentation closeout.
- **Component:** Evidence reporting.
- **Problem/root cause:** A temporary count included the final `PASS — ...`
  summary line in addition to the named checks.
- **Resolution:** Count only named gate rows and correct all recorded totals.
- **Verification:** 20 named PASS rows, 0 FAIL rows, 1 named SKIPPED row.
- **Commit:** `0be6afbd92209953d918d5c0516662bc54f0d081`.
- **Status:** RESOLVED.
